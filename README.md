# 🍕 Pizza Delivery Insights

A comprehensive data analysis project that explores pizza delivery performance, delays, and order patterns using Python and Power BI.

## 🛠 Tools Used

- **Python (Jupyter Notebook)** – for data cleaning, preprocessing, and initial exploratory analysis.
- **Power BI** – for deep-dive visual analysis and building a compelling interactive dashboard.


## 📊 Project Overview

This project analyzes pizza delivery data to uncover key insights about:
- Delivery time accuracy
- Delay trends and causes
- Traffic level impacts
- Pizza complexity and topping density
- Restaurant performance
- Ordering patterns during peak hours and weekends


## 🔍 Workflow Summary

1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation (Python):**
   - Removed nulls and duplicates
   - Fixed inconsistencies in location and restaurant names
   - Engineered new features such as delay status, estimated duration, and time-based fields

2. **Exploratory Analysis (Python):**
   - Analyzed delivery efficiency, traffic levels, and pizza-related features
   - Generated initial observations to guide BI visualization

3. **Business Intelligence Dashboard (Power BI):**
   - Designed a story-driven dashboard with interactive visuals
   - Segmented into:
     - **Overview**: General KPIs and delivery metrics
     - **Order Insights**: Pizza type, size, and topping patterns
     - **Delay Analysis**: Delay patterns and restaurant performance

## ✨ Storytelling Objective

This project doesn’t just analyze numbers — it tells the **story of how pizza is delivered**, what affects delivery time, and how operations can be optimized based on traffic, complexity, and customer behavior.
